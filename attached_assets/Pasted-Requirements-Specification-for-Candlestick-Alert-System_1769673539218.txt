Requirements Specification for Candlestick Alert System
1. Project Overview
Develop a Python application that interacts with TradingView's API to fetch monthly candlestick data for all Indian stocks and generates buy/sell alerts based on specified conditions.
2. Prerequisites
•	TradingView API: Access required for fetching candlestick data.
•	Python Libraries: 
o	requests: For making API calls.
o	pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
o	matplotlib: (optional) For visual representation of the data.
o	Integration of a Free LLM for analysis (good to have it).
3. Workflow Breakdown
Step 1: Fetch Data
•	Function: fetch_candlestick_data(symbol, interval, start_date, end_date)
•	Description: Retrieves monthly candlestick data for all Indian stocks from the TradingView API.
Step 2: Data Processing
•	Function: process_data(data)
•	Description: Parses the fetched data to extract opening and closing prices of relevant candles.
Step 3: Comparison Logic
•	Function: generate_signals(data)
•	Description: 
o	Buy Signal: 
	If the previous candle is red: 
	Check if the closing price of the current green candle is higher than the opening price of the red candle.
o	Sell Signal: 
	If the previous candle is green: 
	Check if the closing price of the current red candle is lower than the opening price of the green candle.
Step 4: Alerts Generation
•	Function: send_alert(message)
•	Description: 
o	Set up a notification system to send alerts via email/SMS when conditions for buy/sell signals are met.
Step 5: Main Function
•	Function: main()
•	Description: Orchestrates the fetching, processing of data, and execution of alert logic.
4. Additional Improvements
•	Error Handling: Implement exception handling for API calls and data processing.
•	Notification System: Real-time alert system through email/SMS.
•	Visual Representation: Use matplotlib for candlestick chart visualisations.

6. New Features for Dashboard
•	Dashboard: 
o	Overview of all Indian stocks 
o	Table displaying the top 10 affected stocks with signals. Also on click I could be able to see the details why Green -> Bullish (Close > Open) or Red -> Bearish (Close < Open) – graphical represnetation
o	Real-time stats: Total stocks, Buy/Sell signals, Emails sent.
•	Stock Scanner: 
o	Option to scan all NSE stocks with filtering capabilities.
o	Progress bar for real-time updates.
•	Alerts Tab: 
o	View generated alerts with filtering options.
o	Ability to export alerts to file.
•	Email Settings: 
o	Configure recipient emails, automate alerts, and test email functionality through emailjs.
7. Email Setup Instructions
•	Add an email service (e.g., Gmail/Outlook).
•	Create an email template with variables: {{to_email}}, {{subject}}, {{message}}.
Conclusion
This structured approach outlines the requirements, workflow, and essential components necessary for building a robust candlestick alert system. Implementing the steps as detailed will facilitate effective monitoring of stock performance, enabling timely buy and sell decisions based on candlestick pattern analysis.
